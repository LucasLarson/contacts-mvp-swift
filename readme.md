Your assignment has git logs, unit tests, and one UI test with around 57% code coverage. You also have a nice app icon, a working adding contact, contact validations, there are contact details and functionality for accessories, showing photos functionality, you added refresh indicator in contact list, and also added contact delete functionality.
